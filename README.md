I'm a learner in software development with an interest in how different parts of a system come together, from interfaces to logic and data. I enjoy exploring front-end work, but also spend time understanding algorithms, basic backend concepts, and how applications behave under the hood. I like building small projects that help me grow step by step, experimenting with different tools, and learning through hands-on practice. Always improving, always curious.🚀💡
